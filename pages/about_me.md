## Interests

I am one of those weirdos that actually like programming. `:>`

In particular, I enjoy writing `macros`, `libraries`, and `frameworks`, in that order; which is to say I love authoring code that others depend on.

My favourite languages are: `Clojure`, `Prolog`, and of course `Haskell`.

Though my weapons of choice are a bit more practical, that is to say: `FSharp`, `Typescript`, and `Python`.
